This project was to examine the behavior, dietary choices, and puzzle problem - solving capabilities of urban raccoons as a measure of
their intelligence and adptability to urban environments. 
Our hypothesis was to see if urban raccoons would be able to solve dog treat puzzles prepared in the forest in order to receive food as 
an award.

## Methods

Raccoons were filmed at outdoor locations in the Conservation and Environmental Research Areas (CERA) and Herbert's Run, located at the 
University of Maryland Baltimore County. Each location contained three puzzel sets, six in total were created for this research.
Each puzzel set was identical. Six 16"x13" pieces of plywood had an easy and a hard puzzle attached with screws, and the pylwood was
staked to the ground via holes in each corner. Three boards were placed at various locations within CERA and Herbert's Run, and GPS 
points were recorded. Each site was visited every 24 hours for data collections and refilling of food if necesssary.

The puzzels were chosen based on the level of difficulty to access the food. The easier puzzle required simple sliding and flipping of 
levers to access the food reward. The more difficult puzzle required pulling drawers and sliding a knob to access food. Both required
knocking down pegs. Each compartment was labeled and all puzzles were filled with the same food in the same compartments.The food used 
was honey roasted peanuts, apples, Friskies dry cat food, mini marshmallows, baby carrot sticks, and sardines.

Filming was done with 12 Bushnell Trophy Cam HD Aggressors. Each of our 6 puzzle sets had two of these cameras, one parallel (facing
downwaard on the puzzle) and one perpendicular (facing the puzzle from a snag across from it). The caeras were used to film the raccoons
attempting the puzzles, the time it took for them to solve the puzzles, the components of the puzzles they attempted, and to observe if 
certain foods available were preferred over others. They also recorded weather conditions as well. All filming and puzzle solving 
occurred from 12/04/2018 to 12/12/2018.
