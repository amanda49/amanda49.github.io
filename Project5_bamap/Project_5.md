This project was to examine the behavior, dietary choices, and puzzle problem - solving capabilities of urban raccoons as a measure of
their intelligence and adptability to urban environments. 
Our hypothesis was to see if urban raccoons would be able to solve dog treat puzzles prepared in the forest in order to receive food as 
an award.

## Methods

Raccoons were filmed at outdoor locations in the Conservation and Environmental Research Areas (CERA) and Herbert's Run, located at the 
University of Maryland Baltimore County. Each location contained three puzzel sets, six in total were created for this research.
Each puzzel set was identical. Six 16"x13" pieces of plywood had an easy and a hard puzzle attached with screws, and the pylwood was
staked to the ground via holes in each corner. Three boards were placed at various locations within CERA and Herbert's Run, and GPS 
points were recorded. Each site was visited every 24 hours for data collections and refilling of food if necesssary.

The puzzels were chosen based on the level of difficulty to access the food. The easier puzzle required simple sliding and flipping of 
levers to access the food reward. The more difficult puzzle required pulling drawers and sliding a knob to access food. Both required
knocking down pegs. Each compartment was labeled and all puzzles were filled with the same food in the same compartments.The food used 
was honey roasted peanuts, apples, Friskies dry cat food, mini marshmallows, baby carrot sticks, and sardines.

Filming was done with 12 Bushnell Trophy Cam HD Aggressors. Each of our 6 puzzle sets had two of these cameras, one parallel (facing
downwaard on the puzzle) and one perpendicular (facing the puzzle from a snag across from it). The caeras were used to film the raccoons
attempting the puzzles, the time it took for them to solve the puzzles, the components of the puzzles they attempted, and to observe if 
certain foods available were preferred over others. They also recorded weather conditions as well. All filming and puzzle solving 
occurred from 12/04/2018 to 12/12/2018.

## Results

From our experiment, more puzzle interactivity occurred in Herbert's Run than in CERA. Herbert's Run in slightly more urban, with both a 
campus and houseeholds in close proximity. Both the easy and hard puzzles were attempted, and both were solvable. The most successfully 
solved was the hard one. The puzzle component easiest to attempt was the pegs. The hardest component to attempt was the sliders. The 
raccoons showed a preference mostly for salted peanuts, cat food, and marshmallows. The carrots were only eaten by one raccoon.

## Discussion

No footage was captured between November 22nd and November 27th when we tested Site 1, though there was puzzle activity. The majority 
of the puzzle solving occurred overnight. Raccoons were not the only animals to interact with the puzzles as there were also mice, fox, 
deer, and dogs recorded by the cameras. No species appeared to be in contact with one another, and most individuals were alone. It 
should be noted that the raccoons were the least apprehensive of the puzzles versus the rest of the species involved. In fact, one 
raccoon stole a peg and ran off with it, while others chewed the side of the puzzle, and a few tried to pick up the entire setup. 
Inferences about raccoon age could be made by their size and how they attempted to solve the puzzle; older raccoons appeared more likely 
to use their hands and younger raccoons were more likely to use their teeth. The baby carrots, which mostly went uneaten, were either 
thrown onto the ground or ignored. Baby carrots are bleached, so this may be a cause of them not eating it. 

## Future Research

Performing the same study in different urban and rural areas to see if raccoons interact with the puzzles or solve them differently as a 
result of living in an urban or rural environment. Using different foods to see if it will attract or deter raccoons from interacting 
with the puzzles. Putting the puzzles out throughtout the year to see if the season affects the number of raccoons interacting with the 
puzzle - for example, to see if due to a decrease in food resources, or if more may approach the puzzle in the summer as a result of 
warmer weather. Removing the puzzle but keeping the cameras to record how long raccoons return to the site looking for food.
