For my final project I want to look at Hawaii and see where the
coral reefs lie. Then I want to see if any are endangered at being at risk
of dying, due to bleaching or diseases. I also want to see how much of the
island will be lost due to 10 feet of sea level rise. I would like to make a 3D
map of the water surrounding the island as well. I will also want to see if the
coral reefs are lined up with shipwrecks too.

My question is to see if the islands are at risk with climate change, more
impotently with sea level rise and coral reef bleaching and or diseases.

I would include 3D mapping, hexagonal analysis, heat map, and maybe some python
or SQL.

I think is project is more involved than some of the other labs is because I
want to look at a lot of different components. Also, it combines a lot of
different labs together and it will take a lot longer then the labs. Some will
be to answer my question and some will be for fun and maybe it will
have a correction with other components I will be looking at.

I choose to do this project because I know I can get data on this, the topics
interest me, and I know I can do most of the maps cause I did them in other
projects. I hardest thing for me will be making the 3D map. The reason for this
is because I was not really good at making 3D maps. So, I want to make one to
prove to myself I can make a 3D map and have it look good.

I learned that it is harder to find data that you can actually use from sites
than just having data provided for us in class. The data that I find on my
own is a lot more evolved and I have to sort through to find what I need in the
table to figure out what I want to use in my map.
