For my final project I want to look at Hawaii and see where the
coral reefs lie. Then I want to see if any are endangered at being at risk
of dying, due to bleaching or diseases. If there is any endangered then I would want to make a heatmap of the unhealthy reefs. I also want to see how much of the island will be lost due to 10 feet of sea level rise. I would like to make a 3D
map of reefs and look at the depth of reef locations. 

My question is to see if the islands are at risk with climate change, more
impotently with sea level rise and coral reef bleaching and or diseases.

I would include 3D mapping, relief map (becuase we could never get it to run in the lab), heat map, and maybe some python.

I think is project is more involved than some of the other labs is because I
want to look at a lot of different components. Also, it combines a lot of
different labs together and it will take a lot longer then the labs. Some will
be to answer my question and some will be for fun and maybe it will
have a correction with other components I will be looking at.

I choose to do this project because I know I can get data on this, the topics
interest me, and I know I can do most of the maps cause I did them in other
projects. I hardest thing for me will be making the 3D map as well as the python code. The reason for this
is because I was not really good at making 3D maps. Also, python coding is really confussing for me and I have a hard time at making things run. So, I want to do these two things to prove to myself I can make a 3D map that looks good and a code that runs the way I want it to run.

I learned that it is harder to find data that you can actually use from sites
than just having data provided for us in class. The data that I find on my
own is a lot more evolved and I have to sort through a lot more data to find what I need in the
table to figure out what I want to use in my map.
