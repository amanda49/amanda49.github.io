The purpose of this study was to find more suitable nontidal wetlands around the University of Maryland, Baltimroe County Campus. 
Nontidal wetlands are a unique landscape that is dominated by freshwater and not subjected to a tidal influence. Maryland has roughly 
6.3 million acres of land cover and only roughly 600,000 acres are made up of vegetated wetlands. That is about 9.5% of the whole state 
that is covered by wetlands that is either nontidal or tidal wetlands. Within that 9.5%, nontidal wetlands make up roughly 57% of the 
wetlands, which is around 342,626 acres. (Clearwater, et al., 2000) 

## Methods

Study Sites: 
I used the Army Corps of Engineers and the Maryland Department of the Environmentâ€™s official survey sheet and shortened it for my 
project. I did some ground truthing to find the sites and took soil samples every 5 meters starting at 0 meters to 20 meters looking at 
soil texture, color, and the soil moisture content. I also took measurements of the surface water and the water table (if present). I 
used the GPS tracker to outline the extent of the observation sites.  

Data:
I used data from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Services National Wetlands Inventory, the United States Department of Agriculture soil survey, 
and made a elevation map to find the right conditions for all possible natural nontidal wetlands areas.

## Results

I have found twelve sites in total that had characteristics of being a nontidal wetland. Out of those twelve sites, ten out of the 
twelve sites had clear evidence that they were wetlands. Sites one and nine have potential to become a nontidal wetland. The two main 
indicators that were missing were surface water and a visible water table. The other two indicators were iron deposits and an odor of 
hydrogen sulfide.  

## Discussion

My findings suggest that there are a lot more wetland areas around the campus then was originally mapped by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife 
Service. Nontidal wetlands provide habitat for a number of wildlife species and an array of plants. At the sites I saw an array of 
different species from butterflies, dragonflies, mosquitoes, frogs, ducks, hacks, silver maple, pin oak, and skunk cabbage, just to name 
a few.

## Future Research

Due to this study being conducted during the spring, the sites are noticeable. In order to determine if the sites are permanently 
flooded (all year around), a study will have to be done during the summer.
